# LamdaFu

Leverage &#955; APIs to future-proof big data processing.  Mix and match big data technologies at will.  Unify batch and "real-time" business logic.  Unit test on a single machine and deploy to the largest clusters.

Please see the [LamdaFu Wiki](../../wiki) for more information.

Mary didn't have a little Lamb ... da!  We prefer the [Unicode spelling](http://unicode-search.net/unicode-namesearch.pl?term=LAMDA) of lamda as simpler, more intuitive, and is just more BC.
